### Why Choose a Local LLM?

Compared to cloud-based solutions, a local LLM provides higher privacy and security. All your conversations are processed locally, without passing through any external servers, ensuring the security of your data. Additionally, local processing can reduce network latency, providing you with a more immediate communication experience.
